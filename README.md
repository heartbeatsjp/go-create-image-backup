backup tool with AWS Amazon machine image(AMI) written by Go.  


## Example

Simple usage is below. That creates new machine image `ami-1234567890abcdef0` as a backup of EC2 instance that id is `i-1234567890abcdef0`.  
Also, that deregisters machine image `ami-1234567890abcdef1`, this is backup rotate that deregisters machine images exceeded the number of backup generation specified by `-backup-generation` option that default is 10.  

```
$ go-create-image-backup -instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0
create image: ami-1234567890abcdef0
deregister images: ami-1234567890abcdef1
```


## Features

- Create backup for Amazon EC2 instance by Amazon machine image
- Manage backup generations per service tag-based logical group
- Add custom tags to AMI and EBS Snapshots
- Notify error by email


### Create backup for Amazon EC2 instance by Amazon machine image

This is basic feater of `go-create-image-backup`  


### Manage backup generations per service tag-based logical group

`go-create-image-backup` can one or more generation management of backup to a single instance by service tag.  
It's useful when backups for different scheduling like daily and weekly.  

The following commands are backup for the same instance. However, backup rotate is each independent generation management.  

```
# daily backup
0 4 * * * go-create-image-backup -instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 -service-tag daily -backup-generation 7

# weekly backup
0 4 1 * * go-create-image-backup -instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 -service-tag weekly -backup-generation 4
```


### Add custom tags to AMI and EBS Snapshots

Custom tags are feature of add any tags to AMI and EBS Snapshots that related to backup.  
`go-create-image-backup` has `-custom-tags` option that 

```
$ go-create-image-backup -instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 -service-tag daily -custom-tags key1:val1,key2:val2,...
```

In above case, add following tags to AMI of `i-1234567890abcdef0` and EBS Snapshots related that AMI. 

|Key|Value|
|---|---|
|key1|val1|
|key2|val2|

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  

Custom tags are not effect to generation management of backup.
